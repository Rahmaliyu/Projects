#Create an instance called restaurant from this class. Print the number of customers the
#restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again.
#Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the numberof customers that have been served.
#  Call this method with a new number andprint the value again.
#Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. 
# Call this method with any number you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a
#day of business.
